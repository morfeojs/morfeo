# How it works

The purpose of Morfeo is to allow developers and designers to share a design language and to create styles based on it without sacrificing performance.

To accomplish this goal, Morfeo is composed of 3 main parts:

## Theme

The theme is the central piece of Morfeo, it allows us to define the design language that will be used to generate styles.
Morfeo's theme specification can be found [here](#todo), it is strongly inspired by [System-UI](https://github.com/system-ui/theme-specification) but it has some important differences:

The Theme is an _extendible_ object that describes the design language of your application, it's a composition of `slices` that contains different elements like `colors`, `gradients`, `spacings` and others:

```typescript showLineNumbers {22}
interface Theme {
  radii: Radii;
  sizes: Sizes;
  fonts: Fonts;
  colors: Colors;
  shadows: Shadows;
  borders: Borders;
  spacings: Spacings;
  zIndices: ZIndices;
  fontSizes: FontSizes;
  gradients: Gradients;
  opacities: Opacities;
  fontWeights: FontWeights;
  lineHeights: LineHeights;
  breakpoints: BreakPoints;
  transitions: Transitions;
  colorSchemes: ColorsSchemes;
  borderWidths: BorderWidths;
  mediaQueries: MediaQueries;
  letterSpacings: LetterSpacings;

  components: Components;
}
```

The main difference between Morfeo's theme and others is the `components` slice that contains the specifications of your components.

To understand how Morfeo works, let's define a simple theme:

```typescript filename="src/morfeo.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createMorfeo } from '@morfeo/web';

const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#e189f6',
    secondary: '#57a1e6',
  },
  spacings: {
    s: '1rem',
    m: '1.5rem',
    l: '2rem',
  },
  radii: {
    s: '12px',
    m: '16px',
    l: '20px',
  },
};

export const morfeo = createMorfeo({
  theme,
});
```

<Callout type="info">

Even tho is missing most of the slices, the one above is a valid theme.
This is because Morfeo comes with a [default theme](#todo) that is always merged with yours.

</Callout>

### Why a theme

The theme is our **source of truth**, the goal of Morfeo is to enable developers to write styles like this:

```typescript
{
  padding: 'm',
  background: 'primary'
}
```

Instead of something like this:

```typescript
{
  padding: '17px',
  background: '#0066ff'
}
```

Because of a simple reason, **control**!

Just by looking at this simple example, it's clear what can go wrong:

- Why the padding is `17px`?
- Why the background color is `#0066ff`?

This kind of freedom, in a large codebase, will become a mess quickly.

With Morfeo, you can use values that refer to the theme instead of exact values, this way you're always sure that you're creating styles that **reflect your identity** and that are **consistent** with the rest of the application.

## CSS-in-TS

The other important piece of Morfeo is the parser that converts a **style that uses theme values** into a list of **CSS classes** that will style the element accordingly.

The parser is a kind of hybrid API that works on both **build** and **run time**, at build time a separate package (`@morfeo/compiler`) will extract CSS from the JS/TS files, at runtime instead Morfeo will just compute the class names based on the style.
Let's give an example:

<AgnosticExample />

<Callout type="default">

Even though in most of our examples we're using React, Morfeo is completely agnostic.

</Callout>

The `Run-Time` work is minimal, mostly the traversal of the object to compute the class names:

![morfeo's runtime](/images/run-time.png)

> Mean while the run-time cost to use Morfeo is minimal, our goal is to reduce it as much as possible, possibly to zero when possible.

The `Build-Time` process is handled by the package `@morfeo/compiler` and it will be discussed in the next, final, chapter.

## CLI

We said at the beginning: Morfeo's goal is to give developers a way to build better UIs **without sacrificing performance**.
That's why, unlike other `CSS-in-JS/TS` solutions, Morfeo's **does not** inject any CSS at run-time, all the generated CSS is extracted at **compile time**.

Also, Morfeo generates **Atomic CSS** bundled in a **single** and **small** file, the benefits of this choice are massive since there is **no duplication of CSS rules** and, most importantly, the CSS bundle **does not grow with your application**:

<BundleSize showText={false} />

All you need to do to enable the build time process is to run the command:

```sh
morfeo extract --watch
```

<details>
  <summary>More about this command</summary>

We suggest you run Morfeo's CLI and your application together in development:

```sh
concurrently \"morfeo extract --watch\" \"npm run dev\"
```

You'll also need to install `concurrently`:

```sh npm2yarn
npm i concurrently
```

</details>

You can even customize the output, for example, prefix class names and CSS variables with a custom prefix in order to avoid conflicts with other libraries/styles, all of these can be made through the `createMorfeo` function that acts also as a configuration file:

```typescript
export const morfeo = createMorfeo({
  theme,
  prefix: 'mrf-', // custom prefix for class names and CSS variables
  output: './css/my-css-filename.css', // custom path for the generated CSS
  entryPoints: ['./**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}'], // specify where your codebase is
});
```
