# Welcome 👋

In brief, Morfeo is a set of tools to build your **Design System** and **Style** your application, with nearly zero runtime.

## Understand Morfeo

Too deeply understand what Morfeo is, and why you should use it in your workflow, you can think about Morfeo as a combination between 3 main parts:

<Steps style={{ position: 'relative' }}>

### 🎨 Theming system

That makes you build your own theme (**Design Language**).

### 💅 CSS-in-TS library

To _safely_ style your application by using your own theme.

### 🔍 Static Analysis

Morfeo will look at your code at bundle-time to collect all the `css-in-ts` you've written and then extract
only the css you need.

</Steps>

## Ready to start?

<Steps style={{ position: 'relative' }}>

### Write your component

```tsx {1, 3-7} /classes('button')/ copy showLineNumbers filename="Button.tsx"
import { morfeo } from '@morfeo/web';

const classes = morfeo.css({
  button: {
    bg: 'primary',
  },
});

function Button() {
  return <button className={classes('button')}>Hello, world</button>;
}
```

### Morfeo will figure out the right classes

```tsx {1-5} /classes('button')/ showLineNumbers filename="Button.tsx"
function Button() {
  return <button className="bg-primary">Hello, world</button>;
}
```

### And generate only the needed CSS

```css /.bg-primary/ showLineNumbers filename="morfeo.css"
.bg-primary {
  background-color: #0066ff;
}
```

> The process that happens at build time is properly described [here](./todo) in this article.

</Steps>
